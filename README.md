The config files for how I set up my Mac

## Command Line Tools to install

Here is a list of tools that I use to configure my terminal:
- [antibody](https://getantibody.github.io/) - a Zsh package manager that install plugins from the zshrc file.
- [eza](https://eza.rocks/) - an `ls` replacement that has better looking outputs.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - a `cat` replacement that has output that looks like a coding environment.
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - remembers locations in the directory structure and makes it easy to jump there.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)- allows for "fuzzy" finding in CLI searches; zoxide needs it to run.
- [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) - explains what commands do with examples.
- [Starship Prompt](https://github.com/starship/starship) - a shell theme that works with any shell. 
- [Fira Code Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) - Starship Prompt needs it to display some icons.
- [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/) - better history database with fuzzy search.

## Installation
The above apps can be installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/). After that, some of them need to be added to your `.zshrc` file.

You can see [my zshrc](https://github.com/JoshEvans33/configfiles/blob/main/dot_zshrc) file as an example.
